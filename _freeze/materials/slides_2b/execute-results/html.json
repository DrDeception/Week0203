Analyze the value and effectiveness of visuals in a number of real-world contexts\n2.  Critically evaluate the impact of audiovisual stimuli in experimental settings\n3.  Identify effective data visualisation techniques you have encountered\n4.  Visualise how visualisation could be a tool worth mastering for **YOU**\n\n## Lab 02 Schedule - 90 mins {.smaller}\n\n1.  Introduction and Warm-up (10 minutes)\n2.  Visual Analysis of this week's learning (20 minutes)\n3.  Wellbeing Experiment Stimuli Reflection (20 minutes)\n4.  Visual Analysis of Scientific Communications (30 minutes)\n5.  Showcase (10 minutes)\n\n## DataSkills 02 - 30 mins (+) {.smaller}\n\n7.  Speed Data Questionnaire (15 minutes)\n8.  Submit own 'Top Viz' with rationale (15 minutes)\n\n## 1. Introduction and Warm-up 10 mins {.smaller}\n\n-   Overview of lab objectives\n-   Icebreaker: Share ways you 'see data' in your everyday lives\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Icebreaker Tip\n\nSleep trackers, free-coffee coupons, spotify, charts, sports league tables, fitbit etc\n:::\n\n::: notes\nThis activity sets the tone for the lab and gets students thinking about effective visual communication from the start.\n:::\n\n## 2. Visual Analysis of this week's learning 20 mins {.smaller}\n\nWhat do we (as educators and Psychologists) need to do to help you understand and engage with complex topics like Wellbeing and Positive Psychology?\\\n- Discuss in pairs - What different techniques are used to achieve this important goal? - It's not all words (e.g. spoken or text) - What else is in the mix?\n\n::: callout-note\n## Discussion Prompts\n\n-   Visuals? Do they help or not? Why?\n-   Video or audio? Are they worthwhile?\n-   Fonts (begin comic sans argument NOW!)\n-   Even just the lecturer's voice, nonverbal behaviour or facial expressions. Are they important?\n:::\n\n## 3. Wellbeing Experiment Stimuli Reflection 20 mins {.smaller}\n\n-   Reflect on the peace/tranquility vs. urban stress video experiment from the first seminar\n-   Small group discussion on the effectiveness of these visual stimuli\n-   Share insights on how visuals impacted the experimental outcomes\n-   What alternatives exist? Would they be as effective? More effective?\n\n::: callout-important\nThink about how the videos elicited specific emotional responses and why this is important in psychological research. Would immersive VR be STRONGER? Smells? Infra-sound?\n:::\n\n## 4. Visual Analysis of Scientific Communications 20 mins {.smaller}\n\n-   Introduction to the BrowZine app via the library\n-   Task: Find a psychology journal article and evaluate its use of visuals\n-   Consider how visuals enhance or detract from the article's content\n-   What other forms of 'Scientific Communication' exist?\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\n-   Clarity and relevance, Integration of visuals with text, Aesthetic appeal and professionalism, Contribution to overall understanding of the research\n-   Posters, Book Covers, Journal Covers, Academic Websites, Conference Posters, Business Cards?, Blogs, Lab Websites, Software interfaces and UX, Branding\n:::\n\n## 5. Visual Analysis of Communications 10 mins {.smaller}\n\n-   Visualisation and effective communication is bigger than just Psychology\n-   Task: Think about what you might want to present visually in the future\n-   Consider how you might benefit from this important skill\n\n::: callout-note\nBusiness Proposals, Marriage Proposals, Websites, Advertising, Blogs, Vlogs & Pods, Merchandise, Wedding invitations, CVs, Portfolios, Dating Profile, Political Campaign, LinkedIn profile etc\n:::\n\n## 6. Showcase {.smaller}\n\n-   Although not graphs. Are these things to consider?\n\n::: callout-note\nThese are just from Gordon, but please feel free to find any others.\n:::\n\n## 6.1 Event Shenanigans\n\n![](images/85543.png){width=\"200\"}\n\n![](images/30175.png){width=\"400\"}\n\n![](images/60045.png){width=\"500\"}\n\n![](images/47514.png){width=\"500\"}\n\n![](images/95984.png){width=\"500\"}\n\n![](images/90703.png){width=\"500\"}\n\n![](images/10573.png){width=\"500\"}\n\n![](images/29882.png){width=\"500\"}\n\n![](images/66984.png){width=\"500\"}\n\n![](images/4473.png){width=\"500\"}\n\n## ![](images/37512.png){width=\"500\"} {.smaller}\n\n## DataSkills 02  {.smaller}\n\n-   Speed Data Questionnaire - including some of your questions!!\n-   To be used for next week!\n-   Submit a response to the Data Visuals you've encountered this week via the link on the VLE\n    -   TopViz - Only one good idea required.\n-   Review the results of the Questions we asked you to provide (roughly clustered so far). See VLE\n\n::: callout-important\n## Give it some thought\n\n-   Mastering Data Visualisation will pay off at Uni\n-   But think bigger and consider how learning to communicate can be useful, and whether or not visuals (data-based or otherwise), or design, typography, digital or just artistic skills are worth pursuing\n:::",
