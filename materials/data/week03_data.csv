The second tool of visualization shows the 2022-2023 Premier League season.

It is very interesting also because it  shows a gradual decline but very slow, meaning that many teams had similar points as others. 

The third image shows the SMART goals which are fundamental when one has to set goals for themselves.

Vapes were originally introduced as a less dangerous alternative to cigarettes, and even marketed as a way to gradually quit nicotine altogether. We can see that they were successful in this first aim, after vapes were introduced the percentage of the population who smoked decreased. However, it failed to serve its function of assisting people in quitting nicotine, surpassing smoking's popularity within 3 years of its introduction and going on to become more popular than smoking had been for over 20 years.

The second graph is one of my favourite examples of data-visualization as it shows how easy it is for data to be represented misleadingly. By using human silhouettes as bars for the bar graph and starting the height scale from 5""0 rather than 0, the graph is able to create the illusion that men from the UK are over twice the size of Indonesian ones. This illusion is assisted by the fact that the graph doesn't take width into account, simply scaling up the silhouette's size to match the height.

Florence Nightingale chose to use a polar area graph as it represented the data she wanted to communicate in an easily understandable way. She wanted to draw attention many soldiers were dying, not from battle but from illnesses that were preventable or treatable if resources were managed in a better way, The polar area graph is a perfect way to represent that, from just a quick glance you can immediately take in the scope of the problem
