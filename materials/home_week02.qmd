## Overview

This is a website built using Quarto. Don't be afraid. If Gordon can do it, you can do it.

This week we're going to start by trying to demonstrate that using design principles and using a creative mindset to approach the challenges of communicating science can lead to some really exciting outcomes.

We are going to talk about some of the tools that you might end up using during the course of your degree, the point being that they will be useful hopefully for the rest of your lives. 

One of the joys of reading Psychology at Goldsmiths is the artistic environment and spirit of creativity. By investing just a little thought, time and energy, you could bring the arts and sciences closer together!
