## [Let's start looking at some examples]{.gold}

The first question is "What do you want to show?"

## Histograms
Histograms are used to study the distribution of one or a few variables. Checking the distribution of your variables one by one is probably the first task you should do when you get a new dataset. It delivers a good quantity of information. Several distribution shapes exist, here is an illustration of the 6 most common ones:

## Histogrma
```{r}
#| echo: false

# Build dataset with different distributions
data <- data.frame(
  type = c(rep("edge peak", 1000), rep("comb", 1000), rep("normal", 1000), rep("uniform", 1000), rep("bimodal", 1000), rep("skewed", 1000)),
  value = c(
    rnorm(900), rep(3, 100),  # edge peak
    rnorm(360, sd=0.5), rep(c(-1,-0.75,-0.5,-0.25,0,0.25,0.5,0.75), 80),  # comb
    rnorm(1000),  # normal
    runif(1000),  # uniform
    c(rnorm(500, mean=-2), rnorm(500, mean=2)),  # bimodal
    rlnorm(1000, meanlog=0, sdlog=1)  # skewed (log-normal)
  )
)

# Represent it
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(hrbrthemes)

ggplot(data, aes(x=value)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.9) +
  facet_wrap(~type, scales="free") +
  theme_ipsum() +
  theme(
    panel.spacing = unit(0.1, "lines"),
    axis.title.x=element_blank(),
    axis.text.x=element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x=element_blank()
  ) +
  geom_histogram(data = ~ .x[.x$type == "edge peak",], binwidth = 0.2) +
  geom_histogram(data = ~ .x[.x$type == "comb",], binwidth = 0.1) +
  geom_histogram(data = ~ .x[.x$type == "normal",], binwidth = 0.3) +
  geom_histogram(data = ~ .x[.x$type == "uniform",], binwidth = 0.05) +
  geom_histogram(data = ~ .x[.x$type == "bimodal",], binwidth = 0.3) +
  geom_histogram(data = ~ .x[.x$type == "skewed",], binwidth = 0.2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Build dataset with different distributions
data <- data.frame(
  type = c( rep("variable 1", 1000), rep("variable 2", 1000) ),
  value = c( rnorm(1000), rnorm(1000, mean=4) )
)

# Represent it
p <- data %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=value, fill=type)) +
    geom_histogram( color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.6, position = 'identity') +
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("#69b3a2", "#404080")) +
    theme_ipsum() +
    labs(fill="")
```
