## Lab 02 Learning Objectives {.smaller}

By the end of lab 02, you will be able to:

1. Analyze the value and effectiveness of visuals in a number of real-world contexts
2. Critically evaluate the impact of audiovisual stimuli in experimental settings
3. Identify effective data visualisation techniques you have encountered
4. Visualise how visualisation could be a tool worth mastering for **YOU**

## Lab 02 Schedule - 90 mins{.smaller}

1. Introduction and Warm-up (10 minutes)
2. Visual Analysis of this week's learning (20 minutes)
3. Wellbeing Experiment Stimuli Reflection (20 minutes)
5. Visual Analysis of Scientific Communications (30 minutes)
6. Showcase (10 minutes)

## DataSkills 02 - 30 mins (+){.smaller}

7. Speed Data Questionnaire (15 minutes)
8. Submit own 'Top Viz' with rationale (15 minutes)

## 1. Introduction and Warm-up 10 mins{.smaller}

- Overview of lab objectives
- Icebreaker: Share ways you 'see data' in your everyday lives

::: {.callout-tip}
## Icebreaker Tip
Sleep trackers, free-coffee coupons, spotify, charts, sports league tables, fitbit etc
:::

::: {.notes}
This activity sets the tone for the lab and gets students thinking about effective visual communication from the start.
:::

## 2. Visual Analysis of this week's learning 20 mins{.smaller}

What do we need to do to help you understand and engage with complex topics like Wellbeing and Positive Psychology?  
- Discuss in pairs
    - What different techniques are used to achieve this important goal? 
- It's not all words (e.g. spoken or text)
    - What else is in the mix? 

::: {.callout-note}
## Discussion Prompts
- Visuals? Do they help or not? Why?
- Video or audio? Are they worthwhile?
- Even just the lecturer's voice, nonverbal behaviour or facial expressions. Are they important?
:::

## 3. Wellbeing Experiment Stimuli Reflection 20 mins{.smaller}

- Reflect on the peace/tranquility vs. urban stress video experiment from the first seminar
- Small group discussion on the effectiveness of these visual stimuli
- Share insights on how visuals impacted the experimental outcomes
- What alternatives exist? Would they be as effective?

::: {.callout-important}
Think about how the videos elicited specific emotional responses and why this is important in psychological research.
:::

## 4. Campus Visual Communication Hunt {.smaller}

- Explore the college campus in small groups
- Task: Find and document examples of effective visual communication
- Use smartphones to capture images (if permitted)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Visual Hunt Guidelines
- Look for diverse examples (posters, signage, artwork, digital displays)
- Consider how these visuals communicate their message effectively
- Think about the context and target audience for each visual
:::

::: {.notes}
This activity gets students out of the classroom and actively engaging with visual communication in their environment.
:::

## 5a. Visual Analysis of Scientific Communications 20 mins {.smaller}

- Introduction to the BrowZine app via the library
- Task: Find a psychology journal article and evaluate its use of visuals
- Consider how visuals enhance or detract from the article's content
- What other forms of 'Scientific Communication' exist?

::: {.callout-warning}
## Evaluation Criteria
- Clarity and relevance of figures/tables
- Integration of visuals with text
- Aesthetic appeal and professionalism
- Contribution to overall understanding of the research
:::

## 5b. Visual Analysis of Communications 10 mins {.smaller}

- Visualisation and effective communication is bigger than just Psychology
- Task: Think about what you might want to present visually in the future
- Consider how you might benefit from this important skill

::: {.callout-note}
Business Proposals, Marriage Proposals, Websites, Advertising, Blogs, Vlogs & Pods, Merchandise, Wedding invitations, CVs, Portfolios, Dating Profile, Political Campaign, LinkedIn profile etc 
:::

## 6. Showcase {.smaller}

- Although not graphs. Are these things to consider? 

::: {.callout-note}
These are just from Gordon, but please feel free to find any others.
:::

## Lab 02 Learning Objectives {.smaller}

- Speed Data Questionnaire - including some of your questions
- To be used for next week!
- Submit a response to the ideas you've encountered this week via the link on the VLE
    - Only one good idea required.

::: {.callout-important}
## Give it some thought
- Apply insights to improve visual elements in future work at Uni
- Think bigger and consider how learning to communicate can be useful, and whether or not visuals (data-based or otherwise), or design, typography, digital or just artistic skills are worth pursuing
