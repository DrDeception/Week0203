## Lab 02 Learning Objectives {.smaller}

By the end of lab 02, you will be able to:

1.  Analyze the value and effectiveness of visuals in a number of real-world contexts
2.  Critically evaluate the impact of audiovisual stimuli in experimental settings
3.  Identify effective data visualisation techniques you have encountered
4.  Visualise how visualisation could be a tool worth mastering for **YOU**

## Lab 02 Schedule - 90 mins {.smaller}

1.  Introduction and Warm-up (10 minutes)
2.  Visual Analysis of this week's learning (20 minutes)
3.  Wellbeing Experiment Stimuli Reflection (20 minutes)
4.  Visual Analysis of Scientific Communications (30 minutes)
5.  Showcase (10 minutes)

## DataSkills 02 - 30 mins (+) {.smaller}

7.  Speed Data Questionnaire (15 minutes)
8.  Submit own 'Top Viz' with rationale (15 minutes)

## 1. Introduction and Warm-up 10 mins {.smaller}

-   Overview of lab objectives
-   Icebreaker: Share ways you 'see data' in your everyday lives

::: callout-tip
## Icebreaker Tip

Sleep trackers, free-coffee coupons, spotify, charts, sports league tables, fitbit etc
:::

::: notes
This activity sets the tone for the lab and gets students thinking about effective visual communication from the start.

## 2. Visual Analysis of this week's learning 20 mins {.smaller}

What do we (as educators and Psychologists) need to do to help you understand and engage with complex topics like Wellbeing and Positive Psychology?\
- Discuss in pairs - What different techniques are used to achieve this important goal? - It's not all words (e.g. spoken or text) - What else is in the mix?

::: callout-note
## Discussion Prompts

-   Visuals? Do they help or not? Why?
-   Video or audio? Are they worthwhile?
-   Fonts (begin comic sans argument NOW!)
-   Even just the lecturer's voice, nonverbal behaviour or facial expressions. Are they important?
:::

## 3. Wellbeing Experiment Stimuli Reflection 20 mins {.smaller}

-   Reflect on the peace/tranquility vs. urban stress video experiment from the first seminar
-   Small group discussion on the effectiveness of these visual stimuli
-   Share insights on how visuals impacted the experimental outcomes
-   What alternatives exist? Would they be as effective? More effective?

::: callout-important
Think about how the videos elicited specific emotional responses and why this is important in psychological research. Would immersive VR be STRONGER? Smells? Infra-sound?
:::

## 4. Visual Analysis of Scientific Communications 20 mins {.smaller}

-   Introduction to the BrowZine app via the library
-   Task: Find a psychology journal article and evaluate its use of visuals
-   Consider how visuals enhance or detract from the article's content
-   What other forms of 'Scientific Communication' exist?

::: callout-warning
## Evaluation Criteria

-   Clarity and relevance, Integration of visuals with text, Aesthetic appeal and professionalism, Contribution to overall understanding of the research
-   Posters, Book Covers, Journal Covers, Academic Websites, Conference Posters, Business Cards?, Blogs, Lab Websites, Software interfaces and UX, Branding
:::

## 5. Visual Analysis of Communications 10 mins {.smaller}

-   Visualisation and effective communication is bigger than just Psychology
-   Task: Think about what you might want to present visually in the future
-   Consider how you might benefit from this important skill

::: callout-note
Business Proposals, Marriage Proposals, Websites, Advertising, Blogs, Vlogs & Pods, Merchandise, Wedding invitations, CVs, Portfolios, Dating Profile, Political Campaign, LinkedIn profile etc
:::

## 6. Showcase {.smaller}

-   Although not graphs. Are these things to consider?

::: callout-note
These are just from Gordon, but please feel free to find any others.

## DataSkills 02  {.smaller}

-   Speed Data Questionnaire - including some of your questions!!
-   To be used for next week!
-   Submit a response to the Data Visuals you've encountered this week via the link on the VLE
    -   TopViz - Only one good idea required.
-   Review the results of the Questions we asked you to provide (roughly clustered so far). See VLE

## Give it some thought

-   Mastering Data Visualisation will pay off at Uni
-   But think bigger and consider how learning to communicate can be useful, and whether or not visuals (data-based or otherwise), or design, typography, digital or just artistic skills are worth pursuing
