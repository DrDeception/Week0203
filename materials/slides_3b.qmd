## [Data Science Definition]{.orange}

\
\

Data science combines [*programming*]{.purple} and statistics with
[*subject matter expertise*]{.purple} to identify patterns and insights
hidden in data

## [Why is this Course Taught in R?]{.orange}

R is a programming language that is *awesome* for environmental data
scientists

\

. . .

Benefits of R:

\

. . .

| Free | Reproducible | Accessible | Popular | Versatile |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `r fontawesome::fa(name = "piggy-bank", a11y = "sem")` | `r fontawesome::fa(name = "repeat", a11y = "sem")` | `r fontawesome::fa(name = "universal-access", a11y = "sem")` | `r fontawesome::fa(name = "star", a11y = "sem")` | `r fontawesome::fa(name = "masks-theater", a11y = "sem")` |

## [R's Popularity]{.orange}

```{r popularity-ggplot}
#| echo: false

# Read in data
pop_df <- read.csv(file = file.path("materials", "data", "r-popularity.csv"))

# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Make graph
ggplot(pop_df, aes(x = year, y = percent_papers)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x", se = F, color = "black") +
  geom_point(aes(fill = 'x'), size = 5, pch = 21) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Papers Using R (%)") +
  # Tweak X-axis
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(pop_df$year)) +
  # Custom color
  scale_fill_manual(values = "#ffc300") +
  # Custom theming
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(color = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 15),
        # axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 35, hjust = 1),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 18),
        axis.title.x = element_blank())

## [R Data Science Value]{.orange} {.smaller}

:::::: incremental
::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### `r fontawesome::fa(name = "arrows-left-right", a11y = "sem")` Reproducibility

-   R is written in "[scripts]{.orange}"
    -   Scripts = step-by-step instructions
-   Scripts can be run by *any* R user
-   Allows perfect replication of process
-   Programs that require clicking buttons are not (as) reproducible
    -   Would depend on accompanying written/verbal instructions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Collaboration `r fontawesome::fa(name = "handshake", a11y = "sem")`

-   R scripts can be co-developed!
-   They can then be shared like a paper draft
-   Many tools exist to formalize sharing
    -   We'll cover one in this course!
-   Unscripted programs would again require written/verbal instructions
    -   Then hoping someone clicks the right buttons in the right way

## [Problem Solving in R]{.orange}

## [Problem Solving Methods]{.orange} {.smaller}

-   Problem solving is an important life skill generally
    -   Also useful for data science!

\

. . .

-   I *do not* recommend using AI as a problem-solving method

\

. . .

-   Let's discuss some useful strategies:
    1.  'Rubber duck' method
    2.  Google (seriously!)
    3.  Teamwork
    4.  Take a break
    5.  Whatever methods *you* use!

## ["AI" Aside]{.gold} {.smaller}

-   I *strongly* discourage the use of AI tools in this class
    -   E.g., ChatGPT, GitHub CoPilot, etc.

\

. . .

-   Two primary reasons:
    1.  It undermines your learning
    2.  There is an ethical dimension we don't have time to cover in
        this class

\

. . .

-   However, I'm an educator not a cop
    -   I won't be policing you in order to enforce my take on AI

## [Method 1: Rubber Duck]{.orange} {.smaller}

\

. . .

-   Explain each line of your code to the duck
    -   Go into as much detail as possible
    -   Re-read lines *carefully* as you explain

\

. . .

-   You'll catch typos/errors that you had missed!

\

. . .

-   Why "rubber duck" instead of "friend"?
    -   Because it would likely be a dull experience for your friend
        `r fontawesome::fa(name = "smile", a11y = "sem")`

## [Method 2: Google]{.orange} {.smaller}

-   This is a serious suggestion!
    -   Google is truly an *amazing* resource for this

\

. . .

\

. . .

-   If you get an error:
    1.  Copy the entire error message
    2.  Paste it into Google
    3.  Check the first few links to see how others solved that issue

## [Google Tips]{.orange} {.smaller}

-   **Ignore** the "AI Overview"
    -   This is frequently wrong and/or misleading
    -   Click actual links!

\

. . .

-   Use a plus sign (`+`) between search terms
    -   E.g., "R + \<error message text\>"

\

. . .

-   When specific wording matters, use quotes!
    -   E.g., "I want results with *exactly* this phrase"

## [Method 3: Team Up!]{.orange} {.smaller}

-   Group work is a classic method of problem solving

\

. . .

-   Email/text classmates about errors you're encountering
    -   Set up a weekly time to meet and work together

\

. . .

-   Group work & assignments
    -   I really encourage you to work together to [solve
        problems]{.blue}
    -   *BUT* assignments should be produced by you alone
    -   There are **no group assignments** in this course!

## [Method 4: Take a Break]{.orange}

## [Method 4: Take a Break]{.orange} {.smaller}

-   Coding issues can be super frustrating
    -   Totally **normal** to feel this way

\

. . .

-   If you are struggling to solve a problem, take a few minutes to step
    re-set
    -   Physically step away and do something active
    -   Do one of your hobbies for a few minutes
    -   Work on something else

\

. . .

-   Return to the problem an hour or so later and try again!

## [Method 5: Yours!]{.gold}

-   As students, you're experienced problem solvers already!

\

. . .

-   Code problems can likely be solved by the strategies you already
    use!

\

. . .

-   How do you solve problems you encounter in other courses or at work?

## [Temperature Check]{.purple}

#### How are you Feeling?

## [Computer File Paths]{.orange} {.smaller}

-   Computers store files in "[folders]{.orange}"
    -   Folders can be *nested* inside other folders

\

. . .

-   The name of all folders leading to a particular file is that file's
    "[file path]{.purple}"
    -   File path starts at the biggest folder ("top" folder) and ends
        at the file
    -   Each folder name is separated by slashes (`\` or `/`)

\

. . .

-   For example: [*\~*]{.blue} *[/]{.orange} Downloads [/]{.orange}
    BIO-316_syllabus.docx*

## [File Path Example]{.gold} {.smaller}

What is the file path for the **notes** document in this image?

. . .

[*\~*]{.blue} *[/]{.orange} Documents [/]{.orange} BIO 316 [/]{.orange}
BIO316-Notes-Week 1.docx*

## [Practice: File Paths]{.pink} {.smaller}

-   Pick a file on your computer
    -   *Not* one in the "Downloads" folder (file paths are too short)

\

. . .

-   What is that file's path?
    -   Hint: [*\~*]{.blue} *[/]{.orange} ... [/]{.orange} ...
        [/]{.orange} ...*

\

. . .

-   When you have it, show me the file and tell me its path
