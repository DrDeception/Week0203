    "text": "Mean\nThe mean, often referred to as the average, is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.\nAs a psychology student, understanding the mean is crucial for interpreting research findings and conducting your own studies. In psychology, we often deal with measures like test scores, reaction times, or survey responses. The mean helps us summarize these data points into a single, representative value. For instance, when studying the effectiveness of a new therapy, you might compare the mean depression scores of a treatment group to those of a control group. Or in cognitive psychology, you might examine the mean reaction times in different experimental conditions to understand how certain factors affect cognitive processing.\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of test scores with mean highlighted\n\n\n\n\nFormula for mean: X̄ = (∑X) / n\n\n\nWhere X̄ is the mean, ∑X is the sum of all scores, and n is the number of scores.\n\n\nExample calculation:\n\n\nTest scores: 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 \n\n\nMean score: 80 \n\n\n\nFormula\nFor a dataset \\(X\\) with \\(n\\) observations, the mean (\\(\\bar{X}\\)) is calculated as:\n\\[\\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\]\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mean represents the balance point of the data. It’s useful for interval and ratio data and is sensitive to all values in the dataset.\n\n\nConsiderations\nIn Psychology, it’s crucial to understand the limitations of the mean. While it’s a powerful and commonly used measure, the mean can be heavily influenced by extreme values or outliers, which may not always be desirable. This sensitivity to extreme values can sometimes lead to a misrepresentation of the typical score in your data.\nFor example, in clinical psychology research, you might encounter a patient with an unusually severe symptom score. This single extreme value could significantly skew the mean, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about the typical severity of symptoms in your sample. Similarly, in cognitive psychology experiments, a participant with an exceptionally long reaction time (perhaps due to distraction) could distort the mean reaction time for a condition.\nIn such cases, you might need to consider using other measures of central tendency, like the median, or use statistical techniques to handle outliers. Always critically evaluate whether the mean is the most appropriate measure for your specific research question and dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact of an outlier on the mean\n\n\n\n\nMean without outlier: 300 ms\n\n\nMean with outlier: 416.6667 ms\n\n\nPercentage increase in mean due to outlier: 38.9 %",

    "title": "Descriptive Statistics 2",
    "section": "Median",
    "text": "Median\nThe median is the middle value when the data is ordered from lowest to highest. As a psychology student, understanding the median is crucial because it provides a measure of central tendency that is less affected by extreme values or outliers compared to the mean.\nIn psychological research, you’ll often encounter situations where the median is more appropriate than the mean. For example:\n\nWhen studying income levels in relation to mental health, income distributions are often skewed (many people with lower incomes, fewer with very high incomes). The median income gives a better representation of the “typical” income in this case.\nIn clinical psychology, when measuring the severity of symptoms, you might have a few patients with extremely severe symptoms. The median symptom score would be less influenced by these extreme cases than the mean.\nIn developmental psychology, when looking at developmental milestones (e.g., age at first word), some children might be very early or very late. The median age would give a more robust measure of the typical age for reaching the milestone.\nIn psychophysics experiments, reaction times often have a skewed distribution with some very long responses. The median reaction time is often used as it’s less sensitive to these occasional long responses.\n\nRemember, the median divides the data into two equal halves: 50% of the data points are below the median, and 50% are above. This property makes the median particularly useful for describing the “typical” value in skewed distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of Mean and Median in a Skewed Distribution\n\n\n\n\nMean reaction time: 347.8 ms\n\n\nMedian reaction time: 315.9 ms\n\n\nDifference (Mean - Median): 31.9 ms\n\n\nThe mean is higher than the median, indicating a right-skewed distribution.\nThis suggests some unusually long reaction times are pulling the mean up.\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\nOrder the data from lowest to highest.\nIf \\(n\\) is odd, the median is the middle value.\nIf \\(n\\) is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe median represents the 50th percentile of the data. It’s less sensitive to extreme values compared to the mean.\n\n\nConsiderations\nThe median is particularly useful for skewed distributions or when dealing with ordinal data. As a psychology student, you’ll encounter many situations where the median is more appropriate than the mean. However, it’s crucial to understand both the strengths and limitations of the median, especially when it comes to the practice of median splits.\nStrengths of the median: 1. Robustness to outliers: Unlike the mean, the median is not heavily influenced by extreme values, making it useful for skewed data often found in psychological research (e.g., reaction times, income levels). 2. Appropriate for ordinal data: For Likert scales or ranked data, the median can be more meaningful than the mean. 3. Easy interpretation: The median represents the middle value, with 50% of observations above and 50% below.\nHowever, the use of median splits on continuous data is a controversial practice in psychology that you should approach with caution:\nMedian Split: This is the practice of dividing a continuous variable into two groups based on the median value. For example, splitting participants into “high anxiety” and “low anxiety” groups based on whether their anxiety scores are above or below the median.\nProblems with median splits: 1. Loss of information: Converting a continuous variable to a dichotomous one discards potentially valuable information about individual differences. 2. Reduced statistical power: This can make it harder to detect real effects in your data. 3. Increased risk of Type I and Type II errors: You might find spurious relationships or miss true relationships. 4. Difficulty in replication: The median in one sample might not be the same in another, making cross-study comparisons challenging. 5. Arbitrary grouping: Participants just above and below the median might be more similar to each other than to others in their respective groups. 6. Assumption of linearity: Median splits assume a linear relationship between variables, which may not always be true.\nInstead of median splits, consider these alternatives: - Use the full continuous variable in your analyses (e.g., regression techniques). - If categorization is necessary, use established cut-off points based on theory or previous research. - Consider more sophisticated statistical techniques that can handle non-linear relationships.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Information Loss in Median Split\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation using full continuous data: -0.562 \n\n\nCorrelation after median split: -0.424 \n\n\nInformation loss: 43.1 %",

    "text": "Mode\nThe mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. As a psychology student, understanding the mode is crucial, especially when dealing with categorical data or when you want to identify the most common response or behavior in a study.\n\nCalculation\nTo find the mode: 1. List all unique values in the dataset. 2. Count the frequency of each value. 3. Identify the value(s) with the highest frequency.\nUnlike the mean and median, the mode doesn’t require numerical data, making it versatile for various types of psychological data.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe mode represents the most common value(s) in the dataset. Datasets can be: - Unimodal: One mode (most common in many psychological measures) - Bimodal: Two modes (might indicate two distinct groups in your sample) - Multimodal: More than two modes (could suggest complex patterns in your data)\nIn psychology, the mode is particularly useful for: 1. Analyzing categorical data (e.g., most common diagnosis in a clinical sample) 2. Understanding preferences (e.g., most popular response in a survey) 3. Identifying typical behaviors (e.g., most frequent reaction in a social psychology experiment)\n\n\nConsiderations\n\nNominal data: The mode is the only measure of central tendency that’s meaningful for nominal data (e.g., categories with no intrinsic order).\nDiscrete data: For discrete numerical data (e.g., Likert scales), the mode can provide insights into the most common response.\nContinuous data: The mode is less useful for continuous data, as exact repetitions are less likely. However, you can group continuous data into intervals and find the modal interval.\nMultiple modes: When data is bimodal or multimodal, it often suggests underlying patterns or subgroups in your sample, which may warrant further investigation.\nStability: The mode can be unstable in small datasets, where small changes can lead to a different mode.\nCompleteness: Unlike the mean or median, the mode doesn’t take into account the entire distribution of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Responses in a Psychological Survey\n\n\n\n\nMode: 3 \n\n\nInterpretation: The most common response was 3 on the 5-point scale.\n\n\nThe distribution appears to be unimodal, with a clear single most common response.\n\n\n\nComparison with other measures of central tendency:\n\n\nMean: 2.99 \n\n\nMedian: 3 \n\n\n\nWhile the mean and median provide the 'average' and 'middle' responses,\n\n\nthe mode specifically identifies the most frequent response, which can be\n\n\nparticularly informative for Likert scale data in psychological research.",

For example, the comb distribution can often denote a rounding that has been applied to the variable or another mistake.\nAs a second step, histogram allow to compare the distribution of a few variables. Don’t compare more than 3 or 4, it would make the figure cluttered and unreadable.

It uses a kernel density estimate to show the probability density function of the variable. It is a smoothed version of the histogram and is used in the same concept.\nHere is an example showing the distribution of the night price of Rbnb appartements in the south of France:\n\n# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Load dataset from github\ndata &lt;- read.table(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/1_OneNum.csv\", header=TRUE)\n\n# Make the density plot\nfiltered_data &lt;- subset(data, price &lt; 300)\n\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = price)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"#69b3a2\", color = \"#e9ecef\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  ggtitle(\"Night price distribution of Airbnb apartments\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity plots are used to study the distribution of one or a few variables. Checking the distribution of your variables one by one is probably the first task you should do when you get a new dataset. It delivers a good quantity of information. Several distribution shapes exist, here is an illustration of the 6 most common ones:\n\n\n\n\n# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Build dataset with different distributions\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  type = c(rep(\"edge peak\", 1000), rep(\"comb\", 1000), rep(\"normal\", 1000), rep(\"uniform\", 1000), rep(\"bimodal\", 1000), rep(\"skewed\", 1000)),\n  value = c(\n    rnorm(900), rep(3, 100),                            # edge peak\n    rnorm(360, sd = 0.5), rep(c(-1, -0.75, -0.5, -0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75), 80),  # comb\n    rnorm(1000),                                         # normal\n    runif(1000),                                         # uniform\n    rnorm(500, mean = -2), rnorm(500, mean = 2),         # bimodal\n    abs(log(rnorm(1000)))                                # skewed\n  )\n)\n\n# Represent it\nggplot(data, aes(x = value)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"#69b3a2\", color = \"#e9ecef\", alpha = 0.9, adjust = 0.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~type, scales = \"free\") +  # Corrected 'scale' to 'scales'\n  theme_minimal() +  # Replace hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() with theme_minimal()\n  theme(\n    panel.spacing = unit(0.1, \"lines\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking this distribution also helps you discovering mistakes in the data.

The graphic gets cluttered and hardly understandable. Instead use a violin plot, a boxplot, a ridgeline plot or use small multiple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scatterplot displays the relationship between 2 numeric variables. For each data point, the value of its first variable is represented on the X axis, the second on the Y axis.\nHere is an example considering the price of 1460 apartments and their ground living area. This dataset comes from a Kaggle machine learning competition.\n\n# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Load dataset from github using base R\ndata &lt;- read.table(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/2_TwoNum.csv\", \n                   header = TRUE, sep = \",\")[, c(\"GrLivArea\", \"SalePrice\")]\n\n# Plot\nggplot(data, aes(x = GrLivArea, y = SalePrice / 1000)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#69b3a2\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  ggtitle(\"Ground living area partially explains sale price of apartments\") +\n  theme_minimal() +  # Replaced hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() with theme_minimal()\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12)\n  ) +\n  ylab('Sale price (k$)') +\n  xlab('Ground living area')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scatterplot is made to study the relationship between 2 variables. Thus it is often accompanied by a correlation coefficient calculation, that usually tries to measure the linear relationship.\nHowever other types of relationship can be detected using scatterplots, and a common task consists to fit a model explaining Y in function of X. Here are a few patterns you can detect doing a scatterplot.\n\n\n\n\n# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create data\nd1 &lt;- data.frame(x = seq(1, 100), y = rnorm(100), name = \"No trend\")\nd2 &lt;- transform(d1, y = x * 10 + rnorm(100, sd = 60), name = \"Linear relationship\")\nd3 &lt;- transform(d1, y = x^2 + rnorm(100, sd = 140), name = \"Square\")\nd4 &lt;- data.frame(x = seq(1, 10, 0.1), y = sin(seq(1, 10, 0.1)) + rnorm(91, sd = 0.6), name = \"Sin\")\ndon &lt;- do.call(rbind, list(d1, d2, d3, d4))\n\n# Plot\nggplot(don, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#69b3a2\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  theme_minimal() +  # Replacing hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() with theme_minimal()\n  facet_wrap(~name, scales = \"free\")  # 'scale' should be 'scales' in facet_wrap()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetecting relationships between two variables\nIdentifying patterns or trends in data\nSpotting outliers or unusual data points\nComparing different groups or categories within the data\n\n\n\n\nScatterplots are sometimes supported by marginal distributions. It indeed adds insight to the graphic, revealing the distribution of both variables:\n\n# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggExtra)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Load dataset from github using base R\ndata &lt;- read.table(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/2_TwoNum.csv\", \n                   header = TRUE, sep = \",\")[, c(\"GrLivArea\", \"SalePrice\")]\n\n# Create a ggplot2 scatterplot\np &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = GrLivArea, y = SalePrice / 1000)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#69b3a2\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  theme_minimal() +  # Replacing hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() with theme_minimal()\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n# Add marginal histograms\nggMarginal(p, type = \"histogram\", color = \"grey\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverplotting is the most common mistake when sample size is high. There are about 10 different workarounds to fix this issue.\nDon’t forget to show subgroups if you have some. Indeed it can reveal important hidden patterns in your data, like in the case of the Simpson paradox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA barplot (or barchart) is one of the most common types of graphic. It shows the relationship between a numeric and a categoric variable. Each entity of the categoric variable is represented as a bar. The size of the bar represents its numeric value.\nHere is an example showing the quantity of weapons exported by the top 20 largest exporters in 2017:\n\n# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Load dataset from github using base R\ndata &lt;- read.table(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/7_OneCatOneNum.csv\", \n                   header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n\n# Barplot\ndata %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Value)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Value) %&gt;%\n  tail(20) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Country = factor(Country, Country)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = Value)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +  # Replacing hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() with theme_minimal()\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  ) +\n  xlab(\"\") +\n  ylab(\"Weapon quantity (SIPRI trend-indicator value)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA barplot shows the relationship between a numeric and a categoric variable. In the previous graphic, each country is a level of the categoric variable, and the quantity of weapon sold is the numeric variable. An ordered barplot is a very good choice here since it displays both the ranking of countries and their specific value.\nA barplot can also display values for several levels of grouping. Here’s an example of a grouped barplot:\n\n\n\n\n# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(babynames)\n\n# Load dataset\ndata &lt;- babynames %&gt;%\n  filter(name %in% c(\"Ashley\", \"Amanda\", \"Jessica\", \"Patricia\", \"Linda\", \"Deborah\", \"Dorothy\", \"Betty\", \"Helen\")) %&gt;%\n  filter(sex == \"F\")\n\n# A grouped barplot\ndata %&gt;%\n  filter(name %in% c(\"Ashley\", \"Patricia\", \"Betty\", \"Helen\")) %&gt;%\n  filter(year %in% c(1920, 1960, 2000)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.factor(year)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, fill = name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#69b3a2\", \"#404080\", \"#ffcc00\", \"#ff5733\")) + # Custom colors instead of viridis\n  theme_minimal() +  # Replacing hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() with theme_minimal()\n  ylab(\"Number of babies\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing values across categories\nShowing the distribution of a numeric variable for different groups\nDisplaying rankings or ordered data\nVisualizing part-to-whole relationships (in stacked bar charts)\n\n\n\n\nLollipop plot: A variation that replaces bars with segments and dots, resulting in a less cluttered figure:\n\n# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Load dataset from github\ndata &lt;- read.table(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/7_OneCatOneNum.csv\", \n                   header = TRUE, sep = \",\")\n\n# Plot\ndata %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Value)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Value) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Country = factor(Country, Country)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = Value)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = Country, xend = Country, y = 0, yend = Value), color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +  # Replacing hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() with theme_minimal()\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  ) +\n  xlab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircular barplot: Useful when you have many groups, though it sacrifices some accuracy in comparison:\n\n# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Load dataset from github\ndata &lt;- read.table(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/7_OneCatOneNum.csv\", header=TRUE, sep=\",\")\n\n# Order data\ntmp &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Value)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Value)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Country = factor(Country, Country))\n\n# Set a number of 'empty bars'\nempty_bar = 10\n\n# Add empty bars to the dataset\nto_add &lt;- matrix(NA, empty_bar, ncol(tmp))\ncolnames(to_add) &lt;- colnames(tmp)\ntmp &lt;- rbind(tmp, to_add)\ntmp$id &lt;- seq(1, nrow(tmp))\n\n# Get the name and the y position of each label\nlabel_tmp &lt;- tmp\nnumber_of_bar &lt;- nrow(label_tmp)\nangle &lt;- 90 - 360 * (label_tmp$id - 0.5) / number_of_bar  # Adjust angles for label positioning\nlabel_tmp$hjust &lt;- ifelse(angle &lt; -90, 1, 0)\nlabel_tmp$angle &lt;- ifelse(angle &lt; -90, angle + 180, angle)\nlabel_tmp$Country &lt;- gsub(\"United States\", \"US\", label_tmp$Country)\nlabel_tmp$Country &lt;- paste(label_tmp$Country, \" (\", label_tmp$Value, \")\", sep = \"\")\n\n# Make the plot\nggplot(tmp, aes(x = as.factor(id), y = Value)) +  # x is treated as a factor\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = alpha(\"#69b3a2\", 0.8)) +\n  ylim(-7000, 13000) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    plot.margin = unit(rep(-1, 4), \"cm\")\n  ) +\n  coord_polar(start = 0) +  # Polar coordinates for a circular plot\n  geom_text(data = label_tmp, aes(x = id, y = Value + 200, label = Country), \n            color = \"black\", fontface = \"bold\", alpha = 0.6, size = 2.5, \n            angle = label_tmp$angle, hjust = label_tmp$hjust, inherit.aes = FALSE) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 24, y = 8000, label = \"Who sells more weapons?\"), \n            color = \"black\", inherit.aes = FALSE, data = data.frame())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not confound barchart with histogram. A histogram has only a numeric variable as input and shows its distribution.\nOrder your bars. If the levels of your categoric variable have no obvious order, order the bars following their values.\nSeveral values per group? Don’t use a barplot. Even with error bars, it hides information and other types of graphics like boxplot or violin are much more appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA line chart or line graph displays the evolution of one or several numeric variables. Data points are connected by straight line segments. It is similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments. A line chart is often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time – a time series – thus the line is often drawn chronologically.\nHere is an example showing the evolution of the bitcoin price between April 2013 and April 2018:\n\n# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Load dataset from github\ndata &lt;- read.table(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holtzy/data_to_viz/master/Example_dataset/3_TwoNumOrdered.csv\", \n                   header = TRUE)\ndata$date &lt;- as.Date(data$date)\n\n# Plot\nggplot(data, aes(x = date, y = value)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#69b3a2\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Evolution of Bitcoin price\") +\n  ylab(\"Bitcoin price ($)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +  # Replacing hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() with theme_minimal()\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine charts can be used to show the evolution of one or several variables.

    "title": "Week 03 Worksheet - part 1",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This worksheet will introduce you to the RStudio interface and the concept of literate programming using R.\n\n\nWhen you open RStudio, you’ll see four main panes:\n\nSource Editor (top-left): This is where you write and edit your code and text.\nConsole (bottom-left): This is where R commands are executed and where you see the output.\nEnvironment/History (top-right): This shows the objects in your workspace and your command history.\nFiles/Plots/Packages/Help (bottom-right): This multi-purpose pane shows your files, plots, installed packages, and help documentation.\n\n\n\n\nIt is markdown - a text only language that can be edited anywhere, even on your phone, because it uses commonly occurring symbols to do all the formatting. If you happen to know html, it’s pretty similar. It’s simple (once you get the idea), very small in terms of file-size, easily accessed, and versatile.\n\n\n\nLiterate programming is a paradigm that combines explanatory text with executable code in a single document. This approach, pioneered by Donald Knuth in 1984, aims to make programming more accessible, understandable, and maintainable. When you learn about Open Science practices next week with Stacey, she will probably talk about sharing of data, replicability and other big issues. One way in which we can make Science more accessible and open is by using techniques like this.\n\n\n\nIntegration of Code and Documentation: In literate programming, the code is interspersed with narrative text that explains the purpose and functionality of the code.\nHuman-Oriented: The primary focus is on making the program understandable to humans, rather than just computers.\nExecutable Documents: The resulting document can be both read as a coherent explanation and executed as a functional program.\n\n\n\n\nLiterate programming is particularly valuable in data science and research for several reasons:\n\nReproducibility: By combining code, results, and explanations, others can easily reproduce and verify your work.\nClear Communication: It allows you to explain your thought process, methodology, and interpretation of results alongside the code that generates them.\nError Checking: The close proximity of code and explanation makes it easier to spot inconsistencies or errors.\nversion Control: Changes in both code and narrative can be tracked together, providing a comprehensive history of the project’s evolution.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a simple example of literate programming in R using a Quarto document:\nIn this analysis, we’ll explore the relationship between a car’s horsepower and its fuel efficiency using the mtcars dataset (this is a commonly used dataset that comes installed in R).\n\n\n\n\nDear Reader, be amazed at my wonderfulness! Below, I am going to walk you through the analysis. If you are reading this as a .qmd file, you will see all the code. But after I render it to html or pdf, you’ll only see what I want you to see, such as just the pretty pictures, without the code! Or I can fold up the code here too!\nAnother aspect of literate programming, other than narrating the larger document, you can also add comments in the code, to draw an interested reader to specialist aspects of what’s happening there, or just to signal what the code is doing. When you try to work with someone else’s code, comments like the ones below (but better) are really helpful!\nIf you are reading along in the .qmd file, press the green arrow to the right of the code cell to execute it. And bingo! R does it’s work and performs the calculations.\n\n# Load the mtcars dataset\ndata(mtcars)\n\n# Create a scatter plot\nplot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg, \n     main=\"Horsepower vs. Fuel Efficiency\", # Clearly these are the most important things!\n     xlab=\"Horsepower\", \n     ylab=\"Miles per Gallon\", # Can we change this to Kilometers per Litre for other countries? \n     pch=19, \n     col=\"darkblue\") # The best colour for car-based statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio’s visual editor provides a user-friendly interface for creating Quarto documents. It allows you to write text and code in a “What You See Is What You Get” (WYSIWYG) environment.\nTo switch to the visual editor, click the “Visual” button at the top-left of the Source Editor.\n\n\n\nIn the visual editor, you can simply type your text as you would in any word processor. You can use the formatting toolbar at the top to:\n\nApply bold or italic formatting\nCreate bullet or numbered lists\nAdd headings\nInsert links or images\n\nTry writing a short paragraph about why you’re studying Psychology below:\n[Your text here]\n\n\n\nTo add a code cell:\n\nClick the “+C” button in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut Cmd+Option+I (Mac) or Ctrl+Alt+I (Windows/Linux)\nYou’ll see a new code cell appear\nType your R code inside this cell\n\nLet’s try a simple calculation. Add a code cell and type the following:\n\n2 + 2\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\n\nTo run the code in a cell:\nClick the “Run” button (green play icon) at the top-right of the cell, or Use the keyboard shortcut: Cmd+Enter (Mac) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows/Linux)\nThe output will appear directly below the code cell. Rendering Your Document To create the final document:\nClick the “Render” button at the top of the editor Choose your desired output format (HTML or PDF) RStudio will process your document and display the result\n\n\n\nLoad the data Gordon has been using today. https://github.com/DrDeception/Week0203/blob/3276cb8fa56a466a3e25761523cea475ed4ee4bd/materials/data/Y1W3_data.csv\n\n# Welcome to R!

    "text": "Literate programming is a paradigm that combines explanatory text with executable code in a single document. This approach, pioneered by Donald Knuth in 1984, aims to make programming more accessible, understandable, and maintainable. When you learn about Open Science practices next week with Stacey, she will probably talk about sharing of data, replicability and other big issues. One way in which we can make Science more accessible and open is by using techniques like this.\n\n\n\nIntegration of Code and Documentation: In literate programming, the code is interspersed with narrative text that explains the purpose and functionality of the code.\nHuman-Oriented: The primary focus is on making the program understandable to humans, rather than just computers.\nExecutable Documents: The resulting document can be both read as a coherent explanation and executed as a functional program.\n\n\n\n\nLiterate programming is particularly valuable in data science and research for several reasons:\n\nReproducibility: By combining code, results, and explanations, others can easily reproduce and verify your work.\nClear Communication: It allows you to explain your thought process, methodology, and interpretation of results alongside the code that generates them.\nError Checking: The close proximity of code and explanation makes it easier to spot inconsistencies or errors.\nversion Control: Changes in both code and narrative can be tracked together, providing a comprehensive history of the project’s evolution.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a simple example of literate programming in R using a Quarto document:\nIn this analysis, we’ll explore the relationship between a car’s horsepower and its fuel efficiency using the mtcars dataset (this is a commonly used dataset that comes installed in R)."

But after I render it to html or pdf, you’ll only see what I want you to see, such as just the pretty pictures, without the code! Or I can fold up the code here too!\nAnother aspect of literate programming, other than narrating the larger document, you can also add comments in the code, to draw an interested reader to specialist aspects of what’s happening there, or just to signal what the code is doing. When you try to work with someone else’s code, comments like the ones below (but better) are really helpful!\nIf you are reading along in the .qmd file, press the green arrow to the right of the code cell to execute it.

We will touch on how Excel will likely remain a valuable tool to teach yourself, and then I’ll give you some hard-won tips on problem solving so that you can begin to develop strategies for handling the errors and warnings that you’ll inevitably encounter as you grow your competency in this arena. In lab, we’ll discuss some crucial components of navigating and using RStudio as well as a very gentle first foray into it’s use.",

However, not all points need explicit descriptions:\n\nStrongly disagree\n\n\n\nStrongly agree\n\n\n\nClassifying Likert Scales\nLikert scales present a classification challenge:\n\nThey are clearly discrete\nThey are ordered, ruling out nominal scale\nThey lack a true zero point, ruling out ratio scale\n\nBut are they ordinal or interval?\n\nArguments for Ordinal Classification\nOne perspective argues for ordinal classification:\n\nWe can’t prove equal intervals between response options\nThe difference between “strongly agree” and “agree” may not equal that between “agree” and “neutral”\n\n\n\nArguments for Interval-like Treatment\nMany researchers treat Likert data as interval-like or “quasi-interval”:\n\nParticipants often interpret these scales as having roughly equal intervals\nThey tend to treat them as a true 1-to-5 range",

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe complexity of Likert scales highlights the need for careful consideration in variable classification and subsequent analysis choices. Researchers must balance theoretical ideals with practical realities, often making informed judgments about the most appropriate treatment of their data.\nWhen working with Likert scales or similar measures:\n\nConsider the specific context of your research\nBe aware of the assumptions underlying your chosen analytical methods\nBe transparent about your reasoning in treating the data as ordinal or interval-like\nConsider sensitivity analyses to check if results differ based on the treatment of the scale\n\nUltimately, the goal is to make informed, defensible decisions that allow for meaningful interpretation of your research findings.",
